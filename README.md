# Lung Cancer Risk Analysis

## Overview
This project explores the use of machine learning techniques to analyse healthcare data and identify factors associated with lung cancer risk.

It was developed as part of my MSc in Artificial Intelligence & Data Science, with a focus on applying data-driven methods to real-world healthcare problems.

## Dataset
The dataset contains anonymised patient records with demographic, lifestyle, and clinical features relevant to lung cancer risk analysis.

Key features include:
- Age
- Smoking history
- Medical indicators
- Clinical measurements

## Methods Used
- Data cleaning and preprocessing (Python, pandas)
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Feature selection
- Machine learning models for risk prediction
- Model evaluation and interpretation

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- pandas, NumPy
- scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook
- matplotlib / seaborn

## Key Outcomes
- Identified important risk factors associated with lung cancer
- Built and evaluated predictive models to estimate risk
- Gained experience working with healthcare-style datasets and ML workflows
